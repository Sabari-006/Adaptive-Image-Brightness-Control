# Image Processing & Classification using OpenCV and Machine Learning

This project demonstrates basic **computer vision and machine learning** concepts using **OpenCV** and **Scikit-Learn** in Python. It focuses on image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification using a **Logistic Regression model**.

The project is designed to be **simple, beginner-friendly, and educational**, making it ideal for students, mini-projects, and practice in image processing.


## Features

* Image preprocessing using **OpenCV (cv2)**
* Numerical computations with **NumPy**
* Image classification using **Logistic Regression**
* Clean and understandable Python code
* Suitable for academic and learning purposes


## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **OpenCV**
* **NumPy**
* **Scikit-Learn**

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

---

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash

```

Activate the environment:

* **Windows**

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

* **Linux / macOS**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3️. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
```

If you are using **Jupyter Notebook**, run:

```python
!pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
```

---

## Usage

### Run the Project

If you are using **Jupyter Notebook**, open and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook full.ipynb
```

Run all the cells step by step to:

1. Load and process images
2. Extract features
3. Train the Logistic Regression model
4. Perform predictions


### Sample Imports Used

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
```


## Output

* Processed images using OpenCV
* Classification results using Logistic Regression
* Model prediction outputs


## Applications

* Computer vision learning projects
* Image classification mini-projects
* Academic assignments
* OpenCV practice and experimentation
